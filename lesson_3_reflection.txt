When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would rather use a remote repository rather than keeping thing local when I am collaborating with team mates and peers on a project.
Moreso, when I want to keep a reference of different states of the app, aimed at making changes without any fear of introducing errors.
